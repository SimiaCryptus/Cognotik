        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: June 1, 2025</p>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Cognotik is an open-source AI development platform created by SimiaCryptus. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency about how your data is handled when you use our website (<a href="https://cognotik.com">cognotik.com</a>) and our software.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Collection</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website:</strong> We do not use cookies, trackers, or analytics services that collect personally identifiable information. We may collect anonymized, aggregate server logs for security and performance monitoring (e.g., IP address, browser type, date/time of access), but these are not used to identify individuals.</li>
            <li><strong>Software:</strong> Cognotik is open-source and does not collect or transmit your code, prompts, or usage data to our servers. All AI interactions occur directly between your device and the AI provider you configure (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google), using your own API key ("Bring Your Own Key" model).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Use of Your Data</h2>
        <p>
            We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data. Any information collected (such as anonymized server logs) is used solely to maintain and secure our website.
        </p>
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            If you use Cognotik to connect to third-party AI providers, your data is subject to their privacy policies. We recommend reviewing the privacy policies of any AI provider you use with Cognotik (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google).
        </p>
        <h2>Open Source Transparency</h2>
        <p>
            Cognotik is fully open source under the Apache 2.0 license. You can inspect the source code to verify how data is handled. We encourage the community to audit and contribute to our codebase.
        </p>
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Cognotik is not directed at children under 16. We do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from children.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with a revised effective date.
        </p>
