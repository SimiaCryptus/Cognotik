**Cognotik** is an open-source AI coding assistant plugin for IntelliJ IDEs, focusing on powerful, high-level agentic tools rather than just code completion. Leverage generative AI directly within your IDE using a "Bring Your Own Key" (BYOK) model for maximum control over data, costs, and model choice. Enhance your development workflow with AI-powered code editing, file manipulation, complex task automation via AI agents, and voice-to-text capabilities.

## ‚ú® Overview

Welcome to **Cognotik**, your open-source gateway to advanced AI capabilities directly within the IntelliJ ecosystem. Licensed under Apache 2.0, Cognotik empowers developers with sophisticated agentic tools designed to tackle complex coding tasks.

### üîë Open Source & Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)

Cognotik embraces transparency and control. As open-source software, you can inspect, modify, and contribute to its development. The BYOK model means you connect your preferred AI service providers (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) using your own API keys. This gives you:

*   **Full Data Control:** Your code and prompts are sent directly to the AI provider you choose, not through intermediary servers.
*   **Cost Management:** You pay the AI provider directly, benefiting from competitive pricing and usage tiers.
*   **Model Flexibility:** Use the latest and most suitable AI models available from your chosen provider.
*   **Enhanced Privacy:** Reduces third-party exposure of your sensitive code.

Our focus on providing robust *tools* rather than a managed *service* ensures a stable, customizable, and cost-effective AI experience tailored to your needs.

### ü§ñ High-Level Agentic Tools (Beyond Autocomplete)

Cognotik differentiates itself by focusing on **high-level agentic capabilities** that automate complex workflows and reasoning, rather than simple line-by-line code completion. It's designed to *complement* other AI assistants that excel at autocomplete. Many Cognotik actions leverage a powerful agent platform, often interacting via a web browser window to manage complex, multi-step tasks that require persistent state and sophisticated interaction flows.

## Key Features

* Editor Actions - Edit, Paste, and Chat about code directly in the editor to streamline your workflow
* File actions - Create, edit, and conduct mass operations with AI assistance
* Agentic tools - Leverage AI agents to perform complex tasks like refactoring, documentation generation, test creation, and workflow automation across multiple files.
* Voice to Text - Dictate code, comments, and commands using your voice for hands-free coding.
* Voice to Text - Dictate code and comments using voice commands

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1.  Open IntelliJ IDEA, GoLand, PyCharm, or other compatible JetBrains IDE.
2.  Go to `Settings/Preferences` > `Plugins`.
3.  Select the `Marketplace` tab.
4.  Search for "AI Coding Assistant" or "Cognotik".
5.  Click `Install` and restart the IDE when prompted.

### Configuration

1.  After installation, open `Settings/Preferences`.
2.  Navigate to `Tools` > `Cognotik`.
3.  Enter your API keys for the desired AI service providers (e.g., OpenAI API Key).
4.  Configure other settings like preferred models and agent behavior as needed.

### Basic Usage

*   **Editor Actions:** Right-click within the code editor or select code and use the `AI Tools` context menu (or keyboard shortcuts) to access actions like "Edit Selection", "Chat about Code", etc.
*   **File Actions:** Right-click on files or folders in the Project view and look for the `AI Tools` menu for operations like "Generate Documentation", "Create Unit Tests", etc.
*   **Agentic Tools:** Access agentic features through the `AI Tools` menu or dedicated tool windows. Follow the prompts, which may involve interaction in a separate browser window for complex tasks.
*   **Voice Control:** Activate voice input (check settings for keybindings/activation method) and speak commands or dictate code.
