## Introduction to the LLM Actor Framework

The LLM (Large Language Model) Actor Framework is a sophisticated and extensible architecture designed to facilitate the
integration and utilization of large language models, such as those provided by OpenAI, in various applications. This
framework abstracts the complexities involved in interacting with these models and provides a structured way to define,
manage, and extend different types of actors that can perform a wide range of tasks, from coding assistance to image
generation and text-to-speech conversion.

### Core Components

The framework is built around a few core components, each serving a specific purpose. These components include:

1. **BaseActor**: The abstract base class that defines the common interface and behavior for all actors.
2. **CodingActor**: An actor specialized in generating and executing code based on natural language instructions.
3. **ImageActor**: An actor designed to transform textual descriptions into images using image generation models.
4. **ParsedActor**: An actor that parses textual input into structured data, such as JSON objects.
5. **SimpleActor**: A straightforward actor that generates text responses based on input questions.
6. **TextToSpeechActor**: An actor that converts text into speech using text-to-speech models.

### BaseActor

The `BaseActor` class is the cornerstone of the framework. It defines the essential methods and properties that all
actors must implement or override. These include:

- **prompt**: A string that defines the initial prompt or instructions for the actor.
- **name**: An optional name for the actor.
- **model**: The language model to be used by the actor.
- **temperature**: A parameter that controls the randomness of the model's output.

The `BaseActor` class also defines abstract methods such as `respond`, `chatMessages`, and `withModel`, which must be
implemented by subclasses.

### CodingActor

The `CodingActor` class extends `BaseActor` and is tailored for coding tasks. It can generate code snippets, execute
them, and handle errors through iterative refinement. Key features include:

- **interpreterClass**: The class of the interpreter to be used for executing code.
- **symbols**: A map of predefined symbols available in the coding environment.
- **describer**: A type describer that provides descriptions of the available symbols.
- **details**: Additional details or instructions for the actor.
- **fallbackModel**: A fallback language model to be used if the primary model fails.
- **runtimeSymbols**: Symbols available at runtime.

The `CodingActor` class also defines nested classes and interfaces such as `CodeRequest`, `CodeResult`,
and `ExecutionResult` to encapsulate the request and response structures.

### ImageActor

The `ImageActor` class is designed for generating images from textual descriptions. It extends `BaseActor` and adds
properties specific to image generation, such as:

- **imageModel**: The image generation model to be used.
- **width**: The width of the generated image.
- **height**: The height of the generated image.

The `ImageActor` class also defines an inner class `ImageResponseImpl` that encapsulates the response, including the
generated image.

### ParsedActor

The `ParsedActor` class focuses on parsing textual input into structured data. It extends `BaseActor` and introduces
properties such as:

- **resultClass**: The class of the result object.
- **exampleInstance**: An example instance of the result class.
- **parsingModel**: The model to be used for parsing.
- **deserializerRetries**: The number of retries for deserialization.
- **describer**: A type describer for the result class.

The `ParsedActor` class also defines an inner class `ParsedResponseImpl` that encapsulates the parsed response.

### SimpleActor

The `SimpleActor` class is a minimalistic actor that generates text responses based on input questions. It
extends `BaseActor` and implements the necessary methods to handle simple question-and-answer interactions.

### TextToSpeechActor

The `TextToSpeechActor` class converts text into speech. It extends `BaseActor` and adds properties specific to
text-to-speech conversion, such as:

- **audioModel**: The audio model to be used.
- **voice**: The voice to be used for speech synthesis.
- **speed**: The speed of the speech.

The `TextToSpeechActor` class also defines an inner class `SpeechResponseImpl` that encapsulates the speech response,
including the generated audio data.

### Extensibility and Customization

The LLM Actor Framework is designed to be highly extensible and customizable. Developers can create new actors by
extending the `BaseActor` class and implementing the required methods. The framework also supports the use of different
language models, interpreters, and type describers, making it adaptable to various use cases and domains.

### Conclusion

The LLM Actor Framework provides a robust and flexible foundation for integrating large language models into
applications. By abstracting the complexities of model interaction and providing a structured way to define and manage
actors, the framework empowers developers to harness the full potential of large language models in a wide range of
tasks, from coding assistance to image generation and beyond.
