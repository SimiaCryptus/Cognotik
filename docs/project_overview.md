# Cognotik Project Overview

## Project Purpose and Goals

Cognotik is a modular JVM-based application framework designed to provide:

1. A flexible platform for building AI-assisted applications
2. Multi-language support through integrated interpreters
3. Web-based user interface capabilities
4. Extensible architecture for various deployment scenarios

The project aims to be "a very helpful puppy" as noted in its component descriptions, suggesting an assistant-like functionality with a friendly interface.

## High-Level Architecture

The project follows a modular architecture with these main components:

### Core Module
- Foundation layer containing platform services
- Actors system implementation
- Authentication and authorization framework
- Storage interfaces and implementations
- Common utility classes

### Language Interpreters
- Kotlin interpreter module
- Groovy interpreter module
- Scala interpreter module
- Extensible language support architecture

### Web Interface
- Jetty-based web server
- WebSocket implementation
- Session management
- Frontend integration

## Main Components and Relationships

### 1. Core Platform (core)
- Central dependency for all other modules
- Provides base interfaces and implementations
- Handles platform services and core functionality
- Dependencies include:
  - jo-penai for AI integration
  - Jackson for JSON processing
  - HSQLDB for data storage
  - Apache HTTP components for networking

### 2. Language Support
Each language module provides:
- Language-specific interpreter implementation
- Integration with the core platform
- Script execution capabilities
- Runtime environment management

### 3. Web Interface (webui)
- Complete web application stack
- Integrates with all interpreter modules
- Provides:
  - HTTP/WebSocket server
  - Frontend asset serving
  - Session management
  - API endpoints

## Build and Dependency Structure

### Build System
